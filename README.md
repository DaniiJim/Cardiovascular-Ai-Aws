# Cardiovascular-Ai-Aws


Project developed during the AWS Educate program by a group of students from the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and the Double Degree in Computer Science – Mathematics. The goal is to create an AI-based web application for the automatic analysis of electrocardiograms (ECG), simulating the data captured by smartwatches, with diagnostic and medical interpretation capabilities.

## 💡 Project Description

The system will have two main components:

1. **Medical ECG Classification:**: an AI model capable of detecting heart conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) from a single-lead ECG, similar to the one provided by smartwatches (e.g., Apple Watch).
2. **Explanatory Generative Model:**: an explainable AI (LLM-type) that, based on the result of the first model, generates a user-friendly text interpreting the diagnosis.

## 🛠️ Planned Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **AI Frameworks**: scikit-learn, PyTorch / TensorFlow (por decidir)
- **AWS Services** (depending on availability):
  - SageMaker (model training)
  - S3 (data storage)
  - Lambda / API Gateway (backend)
  - Amplify / EC2 / LightSail (frontend web)

## 📊 Dataset

-Use of public multi-lead ECG datasets, such as those available at:
  - [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/)
  - [CBIS-DDSM (para clasificación con imágenes)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/cbis-ddsm/)
  - [PapersWithCode - ECG Classification](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets?task=ecg-classification)

Priority will be given to data that allows extracting only lead I, to simulate what wearable devices capture.

## 🌐 Planned Features
- Web interface where the user can:
  - Upload a file with their ECG (PDF or CSV).
  - View an automatic diagnosis.
  - Read a natural-language interpretation generated by the explanatory model.
